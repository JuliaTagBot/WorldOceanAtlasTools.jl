# World Ocean Atlas Tools

This package was developed for the purpose of downloading and using data from the World Ocean Atlas (WOA) database.
The goal is to provide an API that has access to parts of [this list](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/indprod.html) of WOA data sets and products (located on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) wesbite).

This is a work in progress although it is currently used by the [AIBECS.jl](https://github.com/briochemc/AIBECS.jl) package and depending projects.
PRs, suggestions, and generally help are, of course, more than welcome!
